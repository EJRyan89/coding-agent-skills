# Upgrade notes

What each release asks of a user who updates, one entry per contract change since the previous tag. The GitHub release notes open with the release's entries; [Releasing](releasing.md#versioning) defines the contracts and the levels.

Validation (`tests/run_validation.py`) compares the contract files at the last tag reachable from `origin/main` with the working tree and fails while a changed contract item is named by no entry added since that tag. New entries go under `## Unreleased`; the person tagging renames that heading to the version and opens a new empty `## Unreleased` above it.

An entry is a `###` heading saying what changed, followed by four fields:

- `Level:` starts with a level word from the Versioning section: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. Before `1.0.0`, a change that would be major is carried in a minor, and the entry says so.
- `Contract:` the contract items the entry covers, each in backticks as the validation failure names it, or `none` for a demand no contract file records.
- `User action:` what the user must do after updating, or `none`.
- `Pull request:` the pull request as `#N`. Until it is open, the issue it closes stands in.

## Unreleased

### A review without checkout_path fails when GitHub's tarball is not the commit's exact tree

- Level: patch. A fix: the snapshot could leave out a changed file or hold bytes the commit does not hold.
- Contract: none
- User action: none, unless `prepare` prints `FAILED` saying GitHub's tarball is not the commit's exact tree. Then set `checkout_path` for that repository.
- Pull request: #141

### A changed path no reviewer prompt can carry safely is an unavailable source

- Level: patch. The field's format is unchanged; it now also lists a changed path with a control character, a backslash, or an absolute, empty, `.`, or `..` segment, which no reviewer is given, so the review is `INCOMPLETE` instead of failing or reaching a prompt.
- Contract: `docs/code-review-operations-contract.md`
- User action: none.
- Pull request: #142

## v0.2.0

### init-ai-config is removed on update

- Level: minor. Major-level, a removed skill, carried in the pre-1.0 minor.
- Contract: `skills/init-ai-config`
- User action: none. Updating removes it; `audit-ai-config` stays.
- Pull request: #83

### update-coding-agent-skills stops at MAJOR_UPDATE on every v0.1.x installation

- Level: minor. While the major version is 0, a raised minor is the breaking component, so `v0.2.0` stops every `v0.1.x` installation.
- Contract: none
- User action: start `update-coding-agent-skills` again once with `--cross-major` after reading these notes.
- Pull request: #32

### deploy.py verify requires Codex CLI 0.88.0 or newer

- Level: minor. Major-level, a raised tool floor, carried in the pre-1.0 minor. Deployment is unaffected; `verify` reports an older Codex CLI as `OUTDATED` and fails.
- Contract: `deployer/tools.py`
- User action: update Codex CLI to 0.88.0 or newer before running `python deploy.py verify`.
- Pull request: #72

### The hidden skill-core skill is added

- Level: minor. A new skill, deployed as a dependency of the skills whose scripts share its modules; it is not offered for selection.
- Contract: `skills/skill-core`
- User action: none.
- Pull request: #104

### The code-review formats are stated as tables, and the unreferenced schemas are removed

- Level: patch. No script read the removed schemas, and the tables state the formats the code already enforced.
- Contract: `docs/code-review-operations-contract.md`, `skills/code-review-core/references/flag-record.schema.json`, `skills/code-review-core/references/legacy-review-index.schema.json`, `skills/code-review-core/references/review-config.schema.json`, `skills/code-review-core/references/review-record.schema.json`, `skills/code-review-core/references/review-request.schema.json`, `skills/code-review-core/references/reviewer-manifest.schema.json`
- User action: none.
- Pull request: #60

### The code-review formats gain optional fields

- Level: minor. Additive: a review record's `schema_version` stays 1, and records without a finding ledger stay valid and read as having no history. A reviewer's output no longer has to carry `prior_dispositions` when the request has no prior findings and may mark a finding as a `repeats` of another; the configuration gains the optional `model_names`; a re-review request's carried findings gain `flags`; trusted reviewer files are hashed as their exact committed bytes.
- Contract: `skills/code-review-core/references/review-adapter.schema.json`, `docs/code-review-operations-contract.md`
- User action: none. A `review-insights` report written before shows `-` in its new columns until it is regenerated.
- Pull request: #47, #67, #80, #82
